# HTMLStubs Project AI Agent Configuration
# Project-specific settings override master-agent.yaml

## Project Information
project:
  name: "HTMLStubs"
  type: "frontend_components"
  description: "HTML Controls Library with DataGrid components"
  status: "active_development"

## AI Interaction Settings
ai_interaction:
  enabled: true
  mode: development
  code_generation: true
  file_modifications: true
  explanations: true
  questions: true
  debugging: true

## Project-Specific Guidelines
guidelines:
  - Focus on separation of concerns in component architecture
  - Maintain clean DataGrid control without business logic
  - Use proper data pipeline architecture
  - Implement comprehensive logging and debugging
  - Follow enterprise-grade coding practices

## Master Agent Edicts
edicts:
  - "Do not edit the data supplied unless specifically told to do so"
  - "Separation of concerns: Controls should not contain business logic"
  - "Use schema displayName for column headers when available"
  - "*********************** WHAT!?!! *********************** - Challenge requests that don't make logical sense before proceeding"

## Alert Protocol
alert_system:
  logical_contradiction_alert: "*********************** WHAT!?!! ***********************"
  purpose: "Flag requests that contradict established patterns, violate data integrity, or create architectural inconsistencies"
  examples:
    - "Edit the data but don't edit the data"
    - "Add business logic to a pure display component"
    - "Make the control both stateless and stateful"
    - "Filter data while preserving all records"

## Development Context
current_work:
  focus: "DataGrid component architecture and filtering"
  issues:
    - "Schema displayName not showing correctly (Cphone vs Cell)"
    - "Data pipeline bypassing filtering logic"
    - "Business logic separation from UI components"
  
  recent_fixes:
    - "Removed business logic from DataGrid control"
    - "Fixed data initialization sequence bugs" 
    - "Implemented proper data pipeline flow"
    - "Added defensive programming for data loading"

## Response Style
response_style:
  tone: technical
  completeness: detailed
  debugging: verbose
  format: structured
  guidelines:
    - Provide complete technical analysis
    - Show code context and execution flow
    - Explain root causes of issues
    - Include architectural recommendations
    - Use debugging output to trace problems

## Override Justification
# This project requires active code modification and debugging
# Master agent's "questions_only" mode would prevent necessary fixes
# Development mode enables proper troubleshooting and implementation
override_reason: "Active debugging and architecture fixes required"
