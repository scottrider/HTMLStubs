## Project Information
project:
  name: "HTMLStubs"
  type: "frontend_components"
  description: "HTML Controls Library with DataGrid components and enterprise FormMock system"
  status: "production_ready"
  major_achievements:
    - "FormMock transformed from demo to enterprise-ready records management"
    - "Complete pagination system with inline editing and bulk operations"
    - "Normalized data architecture with foreign key relationships"
    - "Production-quality UI/UX suitable for business deployment"
    - "Reusable foundation for rapid entity form development"

## AI Interaction Settings
ai_interaction:
  enabled: true
  mode: development
  code_generation: true
  file_modifications: true
  explanations: true
  questions: true
  debugging: true

## Project-Specific Guidelines
guidelines:
  - Focus on separation of concerns in component architecture
  - Maintain clean DataGrid control without business logic
  - Use proper data pipeline architecture
  - Implement comprehensive logging and debugging
  - Follow enterprise-grade coding practices
  - "FormMock Pattern: Proven foundation for all entity forms (pagination + editing + bulk ops)"
  - "Clone FormMock architecture for new entities (companies, contacts, etc.)"
  - "Maintain normalized data relationships with foreign key integrity"
  - "Preserve enterprise UI/UX patterns: responsive design, visual feedback, smooth transitions"
  - "Use consolidated data structure (jobsearch.json) for all entity relationships"

## Master Agent Edicts
edicts:
  - "Do not edit the data supplied unless specifically told to do so"
  - "Separation of concerns: Controls should not contain business logic"
  - "Use schema displayName for column headers when available"
  - "*********************** WHAT!?!! *********************** - Challenge requests that don't make logical sense before proceeding"

## Alert Protocol
alert_system:
  logical_contradiction_alert: "*********************** WHAT!?!! ***********************"
  purpose: "Flag requests that contradict established patterns, violate data integrity, or create architectural inconsistencies"
  examples:
    - "Edit the data but don't edit the data"
    - "Add business logic to a pure display component"
    - "Make the control both stateless and stateful"
    - "Filter data while preserving all records"

## Development Context
current_work:
  primary_focus: "Enterprise FormMock system - Production Ready"
  achievements:
    - "✅ Complete pagination system with configurable page sizes"
    - "✅ Inline editing with original data backup/restore"
    - "✅ Bulk operations with efficient Set-based selection"
    - "✅ Normalized company relationships with foreign key integrity"
    - "✅ Modern responsive UI/UX with smooth transitions"
    - "✅ Comprehensive state management across all operations"
    - "✅ Reusable architecture for rapid entity development"
  
  secondary_focus: "DataGrid component architecture and filtering"
  issues_resolved:
    - "✅ Schema displayName showing correctly (Cphone vs Cell)"
    - "✅ Data pipeline filtering logic implemented"
    - "✅ Business logic separation from UI components"
    - "✅ Removed business logic from DataGrid control"
    - "✅ Fixed data initialization sequence bugs" 
    - "✅ Implemented proper data pipeline flow"
    - "✅ Added defensive programming for data loading"
  
  ready_for_cloning:
    - "FormMock → CompanyMock (estimated: 1-2 hours)"
    - "FormMock → ContactMock (estimated: 2-3 hours)"
    - "Add search/filter to pagination (estimated: 4-6 hours)"
    - "Add export functionality (estimated: 2-3 hours)"

## Response Style
response_style:
  tone: technical
  completeness: detailed
  debugging: verbose
  format: structured
  guidelines:
    - Provide complete technical analysis
    - Show code context and execution flow
    - Explain root causes of issues
    - Include architectural recommendations
    - Use debugging output to trace problems

## Override Justification
# This project requires active code modification and debugging
# Master agent's "questions_only" mode would prevent necessary fixes
# Development mode enables proper troubleshooting and implementation
# FormMock has achieved enterprise-ready status requiring maintenance and cloning
override_reason: "Active debugging, architecture fixes, and enterprise FormMock system management required"
